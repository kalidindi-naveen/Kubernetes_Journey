Steps:
------
1.Install EBS Drivers
2.Provide IAM Policy to Role Assigned to Nodes (AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy)
3. Create Expense Storage Class
We are using Volumes only for Database only.
4. Inform Application Team that Storage Class is created

Note: DB will give different results because each POD has its own Storage(pv,pvc) its better to go with Vendor Managed Services (AWS RDS)
