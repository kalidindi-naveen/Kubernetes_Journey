Init containers
--------------
1. Init containers run before the main containers run. It can be one or many
2. Init containers should be completed one by one.
3. If init containers fail main containers will not run.
Init containers always run to completion.
4. to wait until other applications are ready, to prepare some configuration for main container.

DB and backend both are started at a time. backend is ready before DB started successfully. backend is getting failed because no connection to DB.

we can have init container for backend. so before backend starts init container should be checking if DB is ready or not.
